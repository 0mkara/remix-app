This project packages Remix, the excellent Ethereum Solidity IDE, into
a dedicated desktop application that runs from your local machine. NOTE:
the editor downloads the solidity compiler each time it boots, this is
as per the design of the Remix runtime, but with a bit more work those
files could be cached.
